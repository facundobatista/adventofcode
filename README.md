# Advent of Code

Solutions (and all attempts to get to the solutions) for the Advent of Code exercises.

**Of course, all these are spoilers**

These are all very dirty scripts, with a lot of prints, some of them possibly in Spanish. In some cases they don't even work ok (it's not that they all reach to the correct answer).

Always separated by day inside each year, normally it's just `proc1.py` and `proc2.py`, but you may find also `b` (or `c`, etc) versions of those files, for the cases where I just copied the script and continued in the copy for a very different approach. And maybe even other files with half attempts.

For the first years you just run the script in each directory. As years went by I made the final output more clear, but which one is the "final answer" may not be crystal clear in all cases.
